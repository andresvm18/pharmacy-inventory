# Pharmacy Inventory Management System

Full-stack pharmacy inventory management system featuring batch and expiration date tracking (FEFO), point of sale (POS), role-based access control (RBAC), and operational reports.

> **About this repository:** This is a public reconstruction of a system I developed as a freelancer for a pharmacy client in 2023. The original code belongs to the client, so this version recreates the full architecture and functionality using mock data, while incorporating improvements learned since the original delivery.

## Stack

- **Backend:** C# + ASP.NET Core 8 (Clean Architecture + SOLID principles)
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core 8 with SQL Server
- **Database:** SQL Server 2022
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (SPA consuming the REST API)
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens + RBAC (3 roles)
- **Testing:** xUnit + Moq
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Charts:** Recharts (revenue trends, top products)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Notifications:** Sonner (toast notifications)

## Features

- **Product, category, and supplier management:** Full create/edit UI for products, gated to Admin and Pharmacist roles.
- **Batch-based inventory:** Each product is split into batches, each with a batch number, expiration date, and quantity. Total stock is a derived value.
- **FEFO-driven sales** (*first expired, first out*): Sales automatically deduct stock from the batch closest to its expiration date.
- **FEFO transparency:** Every sale shows exactly which batches were used and their expiration dates, so the allocation logic is visible, not just enforced silently.
- **Sales history:** Browsable, filterable log of past sales with per-sale batch detail.
- **Analytics dashboard:** Revenue trend charts, top-selling products, and role-aware KPIs (Admin/Pharmacist see full reports; Cashier sees inventory alerts only).
- **User management:** Admins can create accounts, edit names/roles, reset passwords, and activate/deactivate users (self-deactivation is blocked to prevent accidental lockout).
- **Traceability:** Any stock change generates an audited movement record (who, what, when, why), attributed to the authenticated user by name and role.
- **Reports:** Sales by period, upcoming expiring products, and low stock alerts.
- **RBAC:** Administrator (full access), pharmacist (inventory + sales), and cashier (sales only).
- **Product search and dual views:** Sortable table view for scanning inventory density, card view for browsing.

## Getting Started

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

The fastest way to run the full stack — SQL Server, API, and frontend — with one command.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andresvm18/pharmacy-inventory.git
cd pharmacy-inventory

# 2. Copy the environment template and set your own values
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker

# 3. Build and start everything
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
```

First run takes a few minutes: SQL Server initializes, then `db-init` automatically loads the schema and seed data once the database is healthy. Subsequent runs are much faster (`docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up`, no `--build` needed unless code changed).

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **API / Swagger:** http://localhost:5000/swagger

To stop everything:
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker down
```

To reset the database completely (drops all data):
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker down -v
```

### Option B: Manual setup

For local development with hot-reload on both API and frontend.

**Prerequisites:**
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server 2022 (or SQL Server Express)
- Node.js 18+

**Backend:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/andresvm18/pharmacy-inventory.git
cd pharmacy-inventory

# 2. Create SQL Server database (UTF-8 codepage required for accented characters)
sqlcmd -S .\MSSQLSERVER01 -f 65001 -i db/schema.sql

# 3. Load seed data
sqlcmd -S .\MSSQLSERVER01 -f 65001 -i db/seed.sql

# 4. Navigate to API
cd PharmacyInventory.API

# 5. Configure connection string (if needed)
# Edit appsettings.json with your SQL Server instance name

# 6. Run API
dotnet run
# API runs on http://localhost:5000
# Swagger UI: http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
# From root directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure API URL (optional, defaults to localhost:5000/api)
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Demo Credentials

The login screen has one-click buttons for each role. Credentials, if entering manually:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `admin` | `Admin123!` | Administrator |
| `farmacia` | `Pharma123!` | Pharmacist |
| `caja` | `Cashier123!` | Cashier |

Additional users can be created from the Users page (Admin only) once logged in.

## Design Decisions

### FEFO (First Expired, First Out)
When a sale is created, the system:
1. Loads all active batches for the product, sorted by expiration date (ascending)
2. Allocates stock sequentially from the earliest-expiring batch
3. Records each batch deduction as a separate `SaleItem`
4. Generates a `StockMovement` entry for audit trail

The frontend surfaces this directly: after checkout, a confirmation modal shows exactly which lot numbers and expiration dates were used, so the allocation logic is visible rather than a black box. The same modal is reused on the Sales History page to inspect any past sale.

**Example:**
- Product "Aspirin" has 3 batches: 10 units (exp. 2026-06), 20 units (exp. 2026-09), 30 units (exp. 2026-12)
- Customer buys 25 units
- System allocates: 10 from batch 1 (exp. 2026-06) + 15 from batch 2 (exp. 2026-09)
- Remaining: 5 units in batch 2 + 30 in batch 3

### Stock Storage
- **Stock lives within batches, not the product.** In a pharmacy, expiration dates are critical; storing a single stock counter would make it impossible to know *which* units expire *when*. A product's total stock is `SUM(batch.quantity)` for active, non-expired batches.

### Price Snapshots
- **`sale_items` stores a snapshot of the price at time of sale**, not a reference to the current product price. Historical sales records must remain unchanged even if prices fluctuate.

### Immutable Audit Trail
- **Stock movements are append-only.** Corrections are made via adjustment movements (type = `ADJUSTMENT`) rather than editing existing records, and every movement is attributed to the authenticated user (not a hardcoded system account) for genuine accountability.

### Transactional Integrity
Sale creation wraps stock deduction, movement logging, and the sale record in a single database transaction via `IExecutionStrategy` (required because the DbContext uses `EnableRetryOnFailure`). If any step fails — insufficient stock discovered mid-loop, a database error — the entire sale rolls back. No partial deductions, no orphaned records.

### User Management Safeguards
Deactivating a user is blocked when the target account is the requester's own — without this guard, an admin could lock themselves out of the only account able to reactivate anyone. This is enforced in `UserService`, not just hidden in the UI, so the rule holds even if called directly through the API.

### Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Controllers → Services → Repositories → DbContext
- **Dependency Injection:** All dependencies are injected, no static references
- **SOLID Principles:** Single responsibility, DRY code, interfaces for contracts

### Visual Design System
The UI follows a "clinical precision" design language rather than a generic dashboard template:
- **Typography:** Fraunces (serif) for page and section headers, Inter for UI text, JetBrains Mono for all numeric data (prices, SKUs, quantities, lot numbers) so figures align predictably in tables and cards.
- **Color:** A dedicated `clinical` palette (deep teal) replaces default Tailwind greens, paired with warm `stone` neutrals instead of cold grays.
- **Structure:** Thin hairline borders instead of drop shadows; role-based navigation that hides pages a user's role can't access rather than showing and then rejecting them.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
cd C:\path\to\pharmacy-inventory
dotnet test
```

**Tests cover:**
- Password hashing (BCrypt validation)
- User entity creation
- Batch FEFO sorting
- Sale item price snapshots
- Stock deduction logic

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions automatically runs build and tests on every push to `main` and `develop` branches.

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexes:** Composite indexes on `(ProductId, LotNumber)` for batch lookups
- **Query Optimization:** `Include()` eager loading to prevent N+1 queries; daily revenue aggregation is grouped in SQL, not in memory
- **Pagination:** Ready for implementation (queries support `.Skip().Take()`)
- **Caching:** Frontend uses localStorage for JWT tokens and user info

## Security

- **JWT Tokens:** Signed with HS256 (configurable expiration)
- **Password Hashing:** BCrypt.NET with salt
- **RBAC:** Role-based middleware authorization, enforced on both API endpoints and frontend navigation
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** EF Core parameterized queries
- **CORS:** Configured for localhost:5173 (frontend)

## Known Limitations

This is a portfolio demonstration, not a production deployment. Notable gaps by design:
- No integration test suite exercising the full FEFO allocation flow against a real database (current tests cover unit-level logic)
- No pagination on list endpoints (fine at demo data volumes, would need it at scale)
